    <h2>Carbon Dioxide Emissions vs. Median Family Income</h2>
    <p>
        The scatterplot of Carbon Dioxide Emissions versus Median Family Income presents a nuanced view of how economic status correlates with environmental 
        impact. While higher income does not necessarily equate to higher emissions, the data suggests a varied distribution where some high-income areas 
        maintain low emissions. This indicates potential for sustainable practices irrespective of income levels. Emphasizing eco-friendly policies and 
        sustainable development can significantly mitigate emissions across both wealthy and less wealthy regions.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> Arkansas' position in the scatterplot, with lower income and moderate emissions, highlights the need for targeted 
            sustainable practices in lower-income areas to reduce their carbon footprint.</li>

        <li><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> Illinois, with its medium income and substantial emissions, exemplifies how mid-income states still play a critical 
            role in national emission levels, necessitating balanced economic and environmental policies.</li>

        <li><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> The District of Columbia, despite its high income, maintains low emissions, demonstrating that high-income regions 
            can achieve lower carbon footprints through effective sustainability measures.</li>

        <li><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> The scatterplot reveals that median family income does not directly determine CO2 emissions, suggesting the potential 
            for all states to implement sustainable practices to reduce emissions regardless of economic status.</li>
